# Hello this is my Statistics Calculator. 
To use this calculator, just enter 1 then input as many values as you would like. When you are done, type 'done'. 
Then, select a menu option from 1-7. Or if you're done, click 8!
Some new features I would like to add are data visualization tools and other important statistics calculations. 
I also want to be better at predicting errors and adding appropriate notes. 
Enjoy!
